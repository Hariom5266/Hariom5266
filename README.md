I am a second-year Computer Science diploma student at DP Jamnagar, specializing in frontend development.
Currently, I'm enhancing my skills by learning Python and participating in a 30-day JavaScript challenge. 
Passionate about coding and always eager to tackle new technologies and projects. ðŸš€
